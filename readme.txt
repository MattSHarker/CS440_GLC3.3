This project is for Team 2: Gabriel Anderson and Matthew Harker
This program will display both figures 3.1 and 3.3

Upon running the program, it will prompt for the file containing the Iris data-set. Select it.
Next, it will prompt for a file containing data for the angles and origins for the vectors. Select one.
It will then show Figure 3.1 using the given information.
To switch it to Figure 3.3, press the space bar.

This program is capable of different methods of altering the data to make it easier to view by pressing different buttons. For example, 'b' is just the b button but 'B' is holding shift while pressing b.
All of these buttons are case sensitive and will toggle a specific aspect of the visualization.

FIGURES
space bar: toggles between Figure 3.1 and Figure 3.3
E: closes the program

COLORS
r: toggles the red lines (Iris Setosa)
g: toggles the green lines (Iris Versicolor)
b: toggles the blue lines (Iris Virginica)
B: toggles the black lines (lines to represent the base angle/origin)

SIZE
+: increases the overall size of the vizualization. The ratios will remain the same
-: decreases the overall size of the vizualization.
0: resets the size of the vizualization to the default.

LINE HEADS
a: Sets the line end style to arrow head
f: sets the line end style to flat head
n: removes any line end style
